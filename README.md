Hello World!

I am a student software developer with The Tech Academy in Portland, Oregon. I have been married 21 years, and we have two austic teenage sons. My hobbies (when I have free time!) are knitting, reading, making music, hospice volunteer work, and being an autism and dysautonomia advocate.
